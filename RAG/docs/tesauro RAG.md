**Components (Focusing on the Generation Aspect)**

*   **Text Generation:** The process of creating text.
*   **Language Model (LM) Generation:** Refers to using a specific language model to generate text.
*   **Response Generation:** Focuses on creating a response to a query.
*   **Content Creation:** A broader term for making any kind of content.
*  **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** A more formal and scientific term for the generation of text.

**Describing the Outcome/Output**

*   **Factually Grounded Response:** Emphasizes the accuracy and verification of information.
*   **Contextualized Output:** Highlights the generation being relevant to the context.
*   **Information-Rich Text:** Describes the output as containing valuable information.
*   **Accurate Generation:** Emphasizes the correctness and factualness of the output.
*   **Reliable Output:** Suggests the output is dependable and trustworthy.
*   **Supported Text:**  Emphasizes that the output is backed up by retrieved sources.

**Informal/General Terms**

*   **AI Search & Response:** A simple way to describe the core function.
*   **Contextual AI:** Highlights the importance of context.
*   **Knowledgeable AI:**  Emphasizes the integration of knowledge.
*   **Informed AI:** Suggests that the AI has external knowledge access.
*   **Enhanced AI:** Refers to an AI whose response capabilities are boosted via external sources.

**Other Related Terms**

*   **Augmented Language Model (ALM):** Another term for Language Models enhanced with an external knowledge source.
*  **Foundation Models:** A higher-level term for the powerful language model used in RAG systems.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** The process of crafting the user input/query.
*   **Embedding:** (If using embeddings) Representation of text as vectors.
*   **Semantic Search:** (If using embeddings) Focus on searching based on meaning.
*  **Knowledge Base:** The structured (or unstructured) knowledge source.
* **Chunking:** The division of source texts into small segments for optimized retrieval.

**How to Use This Thesaurus:**

*   **Clarity:** Use the formal terms like "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" when precision is needed.
*   **Emphasis:** Choose terms that highlight specific aspects of your discussion (e.g., "context-aware" if you want to talk about the contextual nature, "knowledge-augmented" if the focus is the use of a knowledge source).
*   **Audience:** Use simpler, more general terms (e.g., "AI search & response") when communicating with non-technical audiences.
